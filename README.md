Assignment 13 Division of labor: 
To ensure we both got the thrills and chills of this assignment we both created our own set of files. These files were mostly complete, ~85%,  leaving only minimal debugging and memory leaks to work though. We then shared our sets of files with each other. After talking through the different sections, we determined the strongest set of files to perfect and turn in.
